                                    young or vulnerable people who are feeling the pressure to fit in.

                                    Is the person you’re worried about talking as if from someone else’s script? Do you
                                    think they are expressing their own views and beliefs? Are you worried they are

                                <p class="card-text">Some people react strongly to acts of extremism and terrorism, or
                                    to perceived injustices, whether in the UK or in other countries. Sometimes, this
                                    can lead to a powerful desire for change or ‘something to be done’ to address these
                                    concerns.

                                    Radicalisers can exploit these feelings and offer an ‘answer’ to the problem or
                                    issue the person is angry or upset about.

                                    They might believe that becoming involved in extremist groups offering a chance for
                                    violent action and not just ‘talk’ will help them achieve a solution.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">For some people when life isn’t turning out like they thought or
                                    wanted it to be, they can look to blame things on other people, groups or events.
                                    They might feel a sense of injustice or grievance about their own situation or
                                    others.

                                    Is the person you are worried about feeling angry and frustrated by the way they
                                    feel others may perceive them? Do they feel overlooked or rejected by society? Do
                                    they feel they are being left behind and blame other groups or communities for their
                                    situation? Do they seem very critical or intolerant of other people or groups?

                                    Have you tried to have a conversation with them but found they would not engage in
                                    any alternative views and seemed inflexible or rigid in their opinion?</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Radicalisers are increasingly operating online to target and
                                    influence vulnerable people via online gaming and social media platforms.

                                    At first, they can use innocuous or typical looking pages or sites that are not
                                    extreme in any way. Then they will seek to invite the person into a ‘closed’ group
                                    where extremist views are expressed. They do this to make the person feel special or
                                    part of a select group.

                                    Is the person you’re worried about reading, posting, watching or sharing hateful or
                                    extreme content and links? Are they secretive about which groups or people they are
                                    talking to online?

                                    Exposure to online propaganda can increase the desire for adventure for some people
                                    that involve potentially dangerous situations. This desire for risk taking can be
                                    exploited by radicalisers who are intent on recruiting susceptible people to
                                    participate in ‘exciting opportunities.’</p>

                                    their friends, family and community and lead them to seek out new groups or people.

                                    There is nothing concerning on its own about finding new interests or making new
                                    friends. But are they cutting themselves off completely from old friends or family?

                                    Are they happy to share any details or information about any new friends or groups

                                <p class="card-text">Many people will experience a significant conflict or trauma at
                                    some point in their lives such as a bereavement or a relationship breakdown with a
                                    partner, friends or family. This could also be a major transition in life, such as
                                    moving to university, changing jobs or a job loss. If they’re already feeling alone,
                                    under threat or insecure, this can make them seek new solutions or comfort in
                                    unexpected places.

                                    Most people find ways of navigating life’s challenges and will not find themselves
                                    drawn into extremism. However, some might turn to new ways of behaving and thinking
                                    that help them cope. Radicalisers are sensitive to the signals that people in this
                                    position may exhibit, and will seek to exploit their vulnerability. Have you noticed
                                    someone is struggling with significant change?</p>
