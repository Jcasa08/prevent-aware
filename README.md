# Prevent Aware
Prevent Aware is a flagstone project with Code Institute, that aims to show a solid understanding of HTML and CSS. It's a single page website focusing on the PREVENT initiative created by the UK Government.

Users should expect to be able get a quick understanding of the main principles of PREVENT through a variety of media including: text, images and video.

Design choices for this project were focused on creating a sense of calm, while also maintaining a professional and cohesive look. A responsive design was also implemented to provide ease of navigation regardless of the device accessing the site.

## UX Design

### Typography

[**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the project. Examples being the contact and social media icons

[**Manrope**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope) was used for headings.

[**Sora**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sora?query=sora) was used for the main bodies of text.

### Colour Palette

A [**Colour Picker**](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) was used to grab various tones from one of the site's images.

This produced a colour palette like this:

Which was then refined into this:

Selecting a colour palette this way allowed for a cohesive design between both the site's text and images. A Dark Teal was used as the primary colour, namely the navigation bar, headers and buttons, a lighter teal was used on the button to give user feedback. A white was used for text on the navigation bar and footer to provide better contrast, as well as for the background. A light grey was used on the social icons to again provide user feedback. All other text is black for contrast.
